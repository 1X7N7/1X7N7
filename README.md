I have no idea how most of you make your Github aesthetic. So deal with . this uhh, decent one.
 
 I go by the name Crow, or any skin i sit as! My pronouns are he/she/it, and I am 19. 
 
 I'm a bit nervous around new people so
 bare with me please.

 C+H is very appreciated, thought I might not run to cuddle you if we're not close friends LOL.

I'm very into DVN/Hellmet at the moment, thought I'm a big fan of STH, Pokémon, and other Roblox titles that i am too lazy to name.

Check out my stupid friend <a href="https://github.com/corpsegals">Pronto</a>'s github, and my <a href="https://github.com/skibidbanhammer">daughter</a>'s.. and ig her stupid girlfriend <a href="https://github.com/0spawnzers">doe</a> /aff

DNI IF!!


BASIC DNI, DUH. 

You're under 15, unless i've already talked to you and we've established boundaries.

You support OGEKOM, ALFRED'S PLAYHOUSE, indulge in LOLICON/SHOTACON/PROSHIP content.

If you only intent on trying to get with me (romantically.). Geniunely, i am not and will not get interested.

Same goes for venting. Always ask before doing so ; Unless you're a very cloes friend of mine.
